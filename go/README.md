Go files in this directory are adaptations of the Pybites challenges.
These challenges were originally given with Python in mind as the language of implementation and starting code. 

The comments at the beginning of each file are the original Pybites instructions.
They will remain unchanged but the implementation of certain Python specific parts will be best adapted to Go.
